# Openfire External Service Discovery Plugin

Allows XMPP entities to discover services that are external to the XMPP network.  It is typically used to allow clients to interact with STUN and TURN services, possibly making use of temporary credentials for those servers. This plugin provides an implementation of [XEP-0215: External Service Discovery](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0215.html).

## Configuration

The plugin is configured via the Openfire Admin Console. After installation, a new Admin Console page is available. The page can be found on a main menu in the "Server" tab, "Media Services" sub-tab. The name of the page is "Ext. Service Discovery".
